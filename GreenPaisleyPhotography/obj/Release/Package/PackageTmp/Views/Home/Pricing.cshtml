    <span class="dropcap">E</span>very photo session is unique and therefore does not fit into a one price fits all model. Contact me
    today to discuss your photography project and I will work with you to develop a package that will best fit
    your needs.

    All packages include a DVD of high resolution photos that have been professionally developed and
    enhanced. You will receive the copywrite release to reproduce any photos on your DVD. This means
    that you can print your photos at the location of your choice and post to social media sites. Green
    Paisley can also assist in printing, collages and photo book development for an additional fee.

    I do not charge sitting fees. Sessions range from 1-2 hours or the duration of an event as agreed upon
    during your pricing consultation. A deposit of half is required the day of your photo session with the
    remaining balance due upon the receipt of your DVD. Events such as weddings and reunions require an
    initial $250 deposit to secure your date, half of the balance paid one month prior to the event, and the
    remaining balance due upon receipt of your DVD.

    Everyone is anxious to receive their photos. Green Paisley does their best to process your photos as
    quickly as possible. Turnaround time will vary depending on the session or event, but you can expect
    to see most photos within 2 weeks. Photos will be made available for you to review on Green Paisley’s
    Flickr site using a guest pass.

    Green Paisley Photography reserves the right to use any of your photos as part of our promotions or
    advertising. Your photos may be posted to our web site or FaceBook page, or used in printed materials
    unless prior written authorization is provided that denotes otherwise.
